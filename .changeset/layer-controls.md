CHANGED: `LayerControlGroup` icons for opacity and fill type have been changed to be less ambiguous. Icons also have basic <title> tooltips to suggest what they do.

CHANGED: custom pattern definitions can be provided to the `LayerControlGroup`/`LayerControl`/`FillTypeControl`.

ADDED: `FillPatch` renders a swatch of a particular fill pattern in. particular color. This is useful when creating legends.
