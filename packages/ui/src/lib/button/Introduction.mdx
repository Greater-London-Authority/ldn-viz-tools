# Button

The `Button` component has several *variants*: [`default`](./?path=/story/ui-button--default),
[`primary`](./?path=/story/ui-button--primary), [`secondary`](./?path=/story/ui-button--default),
and [`ghost`](./?path=/story/ui-button--default).

It is available in several [sizes](./?path=/story/ui-button--sizes): `xs`, `sm`, `base`, `lg`, and `xl`;
it can be [made full-width](./?path=/story/ui-button--full-width) by applying the class `w-full`.

It can [contain an icon](./?path=/story/ui-button--with-icon).

By providing the `href` prop it [can be used](./?path=/story/ui-button--with-link) to create something with the visual
appearance of a button but the functionality of an `<a>` link element.
This is inappropriate for most navigational links, as users typically expect clicking a button to trigger an action
other than navigation between pages; however, it has some uses such as the "Start exploring the data" call-to-action
button on the [Survey of Londoners Explorer](https://apps.london.gov.uk/survey-of-londoners/).
