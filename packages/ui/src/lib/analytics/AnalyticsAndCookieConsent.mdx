# AnalyticsAndCookieConsent

The `<AnalyticsAndCookieConsent>` component sets up Google Analytics and uses [Civic Cookie Control](https://www.civicuk.com/cookie-control/) to get consent for the use of cookies.
As the cookie consent applies across the .london.gov.uk domain, the cookie consent sidebar is styled to match the main london.gov.uk site rather than the CIU's apps.


Edit the `routes/+layout.svelte` file to the following code, which defines the API key and AppName before using this component:

```js
<svelte:head>
	<script>
		window.ldnVizCivicApiKey = 'civic-api-key';
		window.ldnVizCivicAppName = 'name-used-for-logging';
	</script>
</svelte:head>

<AnalyticsAndCookieConsent />
```
