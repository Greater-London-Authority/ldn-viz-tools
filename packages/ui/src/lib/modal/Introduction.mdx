# Modal

The `Modal` component is used to transiently display content on top of any other part of the user interface.

It supports "light dismiss": it can be closed by clicking on the cross/close icon, by pressing the Escape key, or by clicking on anything other the modal.

It allows a `title` and (optionally) a `description` to be provided as props; arbitrary additional content is accepted by a slot.
