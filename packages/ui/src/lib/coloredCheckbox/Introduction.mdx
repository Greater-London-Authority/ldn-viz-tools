# Colored checkbox

This provides a (square) colored checkbox component that can act as both a categorical color legend, and a control for which categories of things are displayed on a map or visualization.

It should be used in cases where **multiple** items from a list of options can be selected simultaneously; if only **one** item can be selected at a time, then a round [ColoredRadio](./?path=/docs/ui-coloredradio--docs) should be used instead..
