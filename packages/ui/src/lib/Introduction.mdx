# Welcome to Storybook for ldn-viz-tools ui elements

## A collection of components and patterns for rapid, consistent data visualization design for the City Intelligence Unit at the Greater London Authority.

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
