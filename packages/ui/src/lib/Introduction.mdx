# Welcome to Storybook for ldn-viz-tools ui elements

## A collection of components and patterns for rapid, consistent data visualization design for the City Intelligence Unit at the [Greater London Authority](https://www.london.gov.uk).

This package is published to npm as [@ldn-viz/ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ldn-viz/ui).

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
