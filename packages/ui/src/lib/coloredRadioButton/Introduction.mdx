# Colored radio button

This provides a (round) colored radio-button component that can act as both a categorical color legend, and a control for which categories of things are displayed on a map or visualization.

It should be used in cases where **no more that one** item from a list of options can be selected; if **multiple** items can be selected simultaneously, then a square [ColoredCheckbox](./?path=/docs/ui-coloredcheckbox--docs) should be used instead.
