# Checkbox

This provides a (square) checkbox component that can be colored to act as both a categorical color legend, and a control for which categories of things are displayed on a map or visualization.

It should be used in cases where **multiple** items from a list of options can be selected simultaneously; if only **one** item can be selected at a time, then a round [RadioButton](./?path=/docs/ui-radiobutton--docs) should be used instead.
