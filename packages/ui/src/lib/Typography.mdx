# Typography

## How to achieve coherent and consistent typography in our apps and components

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed. We have developed a typographic system to unify our apps, charts and graphical output. Combined with our spacing rules our designs and interfaces should achieve balance and harmony.

### Font

We use the sans serif font [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/). Inter is a variable font family carefully crafted & designed for computer screens. Inter is available via Google Fonts under the Open Font License. By using webfonts in our applications we can be relatively certain that they will used under normal circumstances.
[@ldn-viz/themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ldn-viz/themes). extends the tailwind default sans serif font stack:

<code>
	"Inter", ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI
	Symbol", "Noto Color Emoji";
</code>

### Source of truth

Our 'source of truth' for our designs is Figma where we have carefully matched out figma typography style names to tailwind's typography classes.
in figma our 'text-base' text style matches to '.text-base' in our [@ldn-viz/themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ldn-viz/themes) which inherits from tailwind.

### Font sizes

Font sizes run from 'text-xs'(0.75rem or 12px) though 'text-9xl'(8rem or 128px)

### Text color

Our design token classes should be used to apply text color. This will ensure consistency and correct color contrast for accessibility:

```html
<!-- apply our theme to text elements -->
<p class="text-color-text-primary">Primary text color</p>

<p class="text-color-text-secondary">Secondary text color</p>
```

### Tailwind typography plugin (the .prose class)

[@ldn-viz/themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ldn-viz/themes) exposes the .prose class from the [Tailwind Typography Plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)

> The official Tailwind CSS Typography plugin provides a set of prose classes you can use to add beautiful typographic defaults to any vanilla HTML you don't control, like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS.

**Use with caution** it should be noted that the prose class is intended for **HTML you don't control, like HTML rendered from Markdown**. You should avoid using the prose class in situations where we do have more control over the HTML such as the internals of our components. In these situations more granular classes should be applied for greater control.
