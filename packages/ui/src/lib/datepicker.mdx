# Datepicker/Calendar

We use the [@svelte-plugins/datepicker](https://svelte-plugins.github.io/datepicker/) component
([GitHub repository](https://github.com/svelte-plugins/datepicker)) as a datepicker.

We haven't yet implemented a wrapper around it, as different applications have tended to have quite specific requirements.

For example, the HSDS-Hub implements a more complex widget for selecting a date range (and automatically identifying the immediately previous period or the same period in the previous year as a comparison period).
