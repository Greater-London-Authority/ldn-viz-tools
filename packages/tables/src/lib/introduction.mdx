# Welcome to Storybook for ldn-viz-tools tables

This provides a component for rendering tables.
It includes support for rendering visualizations inside table cells, and for rendering summary visualizations for columns.

## Code structure

1. `core/`

- `core/lib`: these _functions_ manipulate tabular data, and create scales used by the renderers
- `core/aggregateRenderers`: these _components_ render a visual encoding of an _array of values_ corresponding to the values of a particular column for multiple rows (provided as the `values` prop).
- `core/renderers`: these _components_ render a visual encoding of a _single value_ corresponding to a single table cell (provided as the `value` prop).
  If requested by the specification, the value of additional columns for the same row will be provided as the `contextVals` prop.

2. `table/`

- `table/Table.svelte`: this is the main component used by users of the library
- `table/TableContainer.svelte`: this is a wrapper that adds the title/subtitle/download buttons around a `Table`
- `table/cells`: these components represent particular special cell types
- `table/menus`: these components allow the user to interact with the table to change what is displayed and how
- `table/rows`: these components are used to render table rows and cells, but not the data cells or column/group summary visualizations

3. `types/`: contains type definitions

4. `utils/`: contains util functions
