# Welcome to Storybook for ldn-viz-tools charts

## A collection of chart components for rapid, consistent data vizualisation design for London City Inelligence.

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.
