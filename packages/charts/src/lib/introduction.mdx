# Welcome to Storybook for ldn-viz-tools charts

## A collection of chart components for rapid, consistent data vizualisation design for London City Inelligence.

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

### ChartContainer

Each basic chart type is framed in the **chartContainer** component, which provides a consistent framework including Title, Subtitle, Screen-reader accessible alt-text, optional Footer-credits and Download/ export buttons.

### Layercake

Our chart components are built using [LayerCake](https://layercake.graphics), a graphics framework for Svelte.

### Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by the [ONS Svelte Charts Library](https://onsvisual.github.io/svelte-charts/) - in turn largely based on the chart examples by [Michael Keller](https://twitter.com/mhkeller), the author of the Layer Cake charts/graphics framework for Svelte.
