# Color functions.

Our color system for charts is documented in the Observable notebook [@ldn/color-system]](https://observablehq.com/@ldn/color-system).

It exports two _objects_ defining colors:

- `ldnColors`: an object that defines sets of named colors. Each colour is split into a predefined 10 point sequential ramp (numbered `50`, `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, `800`, `900`, ordered from light to dark)
- `theme`: an object that maps the colors to series of design tokens to create light and dark themes.

It also exports two _functions_ for constructing color scales:

- `getColorScale(count, colors, even)`
- `getThresholdBreaksColorsLabels(breakCount, extent, anchorToZero, discreteZeroBin, offsetZeroVal, labelFormat, valueAppend, valuePrepend, colors, even)`
