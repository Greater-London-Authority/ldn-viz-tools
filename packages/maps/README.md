# @ldn-viz/maps

This package is intended primarily for use in projects created by [Greater London Authority](https://london.gov.uk/)'s [City Intelligence Unit](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/research-and-analysis).

It is intended to help use quickly produce consistent web maps.

It is at an early state of development: it is likely to change significantly, and we do not recommend its use externally.
