The quote below is one of Dieter Rams’ 10 Principles of good design and is particularly pertinent to the field of data visualisation & information design (as noted in the book “Data Visualisation” by Andy Kirk).

> Good design is as little design as possible. Less, but better.

<cite>Dieter Rams</cite>

Within data visualisation, “Less, but better” means removing unnecessary visual clutter, but keeping and highlighting only elements that reinforce or illustrate the point we are trying to make with the data.

A chart isn’t the data, it’s an opinion about (or at least a narrow view of) the data, so highlight that opinion.

The same principle can be applied to the titles and copy surrounding and contextualising our charts.

### If nothing else, do this

Whatever format of data visualisation you are producing, keep these fundamentals in mind:

- **Accessibility** - Ensure your color choices have good contrast with the background and differentiation between each other? Have you provided a machine readable text description of the chart contents (and the insight it provides) and a way of accessing the underlying data?

- **Reduce clutter** – Use only the essential grid lines and axis ticks to illustrate the scales.

- **Focus on the key data** – Highlight the data line or points that you want people to see. Make other data, that may be there for context, more muted.

- **Use as few colors as possible** – Differentiation of data through color alone can be challenging for quite a few readers. Fewer colors also make for more elegant charts.

- **Annotate the chart** – Not always possible in a dashboard environment but label the key lines or points if you can.

- **Say what you see** – Provide a meaningful and descriptive title that tells people what they should understand in the data. These insightful headlines, can also be used to provide good alt text for screen readers.

- **Small multiples** – If you’re trying to fit too much data (and color) on one chart, try faceting the chart into “small multiples” of the same chart type.

- **Scale Correctly** - If you are scaling a circle based on a value, scale the area, not the diameter.

- **Bars & Columns always start at zero** - While line charts can (sometimes) have a non-zero baseline (if clearly indicated), a bar/column chart will radically distort the data if not started from zero.
