The London City Data team have developed this design system to coordinate the design of our product templates, web applications and their documentation.

Our design system builds on years of previous work creating data tools for London, and unifies our approach to UI design, typography, data presentation and mapping.

Importantly, our design system creates a new color system, expanded from the GLA brand colors, that works functionally as well as aesthetically, across all of our tools and visualisations.

Good data visualisation isn’t just for internal decision making, it’s crucial for helping Londoners to better understand their city.

That’s why we have produced this guide, and accompanying suite of digital assets, tools and components focused on making our data visualisations clearer, more consistent, and easier to understand.
