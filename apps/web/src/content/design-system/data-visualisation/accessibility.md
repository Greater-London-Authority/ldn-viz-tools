## Principles

Making data visualisation accessible is a challenge, as it is an inherently visual form. The thinking within the field is still evolving and best practices are still being refined.

We believe:

- **Accessible design is good design** - clear, simple, concise and uncluttered are good design principles as well good for accessibility.

- **Provide equity of insight** - A chart should be designed to provide insight into a dataset. Make the chart as visually accessible as possible, but the “insight” can still be provided with well written text.
