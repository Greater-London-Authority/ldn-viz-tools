### Maps

While maps can appear as elements within a dashboard a standalone map application will consist of a global side-bar navigation with the main content canvas holding a full cover interactive map.

### Notebooks

Notebooks allow for long form copy intersected by visualisation elements that can be both illustrative of the narrative and interactive
