## Principles

The system provides a single theme with two "modes" - **light** and **dark**. However we often refer to the mode as 'theme' as this is sometimes easier to understand even if it is not strictly true. For example the `ThemeSwitcher` component actually changes the `mode`. For the rest of the docs we will use the accepted term 'theme'.

### User preference

Both of our themes have been carefully considered to be accessible and offering users the ability to choose light or dark themes honours their preferences which could be due to lighting conditions, accessibility requirements or simply their preferred choice.

### Light theme

We consider the light theme as the default

### Dark Theme

### Using Css

### Using design tokens

### Using raw colour values

If you are preparing a presentation in a non web format (e.g. Powerpoint) where you are not using css or web technologies you may use raw color values. In all other circumstances you should use the tokens provided by the design system.
