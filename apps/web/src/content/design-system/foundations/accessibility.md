We are dedicated to creating inclusive and accessible digital experiences for all users. Accessible, inclusive design is closely related to usability, providing varied and flexible ways for users to interact - options which can be useful for everyone

Since September 2018, all public sector bodies have been required by law to ensure our sites and apps can be used by those with disabilities. This means meeting the Web Content and Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1). These are a set of internationally recognised, testable guidelines based on four guiding principles of accessibility - digital products must be: Perceivable, Operable, Usable and Robust.

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content, creating content that can be presented in different ways without losing information, and making it easier for users to see and hear content.

- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means ensuring that all functionality is available from a keyboard, giving users enough time to read and use content, and helping users navigate and find content.

- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. This involves making text readable and understandable, ensuring web pages operate predictably, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes.

- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be reliably interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. As technologies and user agents evolve, content should remain accessible.

### Practical Steps for Compliance

- **Contrast Ratios**: Ensure that text and interactive elements have sufficient color contrast. WCAG 2.1 AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Make sure all functionality is accessible via keyboard. This includes form controls, links, and other interactive elements.

- **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content, such as images, icons, and multimedia.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that our designs are responsive and adaptive to various screen sizes and orientations, making them accessible on a wide range of devices.

- **Clear Navigation**: Design clear and consistent navigation structures to help users find information and orient themselves within our products.
