## Principles

Design tokens are the single source of truth for naming and storing design decisions such as colors, typography, spacing, and more. They ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability across all our applications.

We have developed our token taxonomy to be:

- Easy to understand
- A straight-forward structure that can be reproduced as variables in Figma
- Keep the number of tokens (and therefore the choices) contained
- Keep a clear rationale to identify correct token use

In order to achieve this our tokens follow an object-orientated taxonomy:

Our tokens are made up from combinations of some, or all of these conceptual groupings. Following our naming convention ensures that each token is clearly defined and easily understandable.
