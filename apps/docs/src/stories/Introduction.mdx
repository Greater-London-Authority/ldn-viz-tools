# Welcome to ldn-viz-tools Storybook

## A collection of styles, components and patterns for rapid, consistent data vizualisation design for London City Inelligence.

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## Writing stories

~ todo ~
To use the Controls addon, you need to write your stories using args. Storybook will automatically generate UI controls based on your args and what it can infer about your component.
